## Lessons Learned

I have learned a lot from this course. First, I learned to cooperate with others. During the event, we have to discuss and generate ideas together to make a successful event. Through the discussion, I learned to listen to others' ideas and voice my opinion. Before this, I was a shy person and was afraid to provide my ideas. However, in this event, the team members are kind and helpful. They won't criticize or judge my ideas even if they are not applicable sometimes. Really thanks to them for this.

Besides, I also learned to manage time wisely. The schedule and tasks for this semester are quite packed and heavy. So to finish all the tasks given, I was forced to spend lesser time on leisure and more time focusing on the tasks. I learned to jot down important meetings and tasks in my notebook so that I don't miss out on anything.

Other than that, I also learned to not give up on obstacles. Problems can be solved. Even if it is hard, we can just break them down and solve them little by little (or in techy terms, divide and conquer).

However, after retrospecting, I realise there are things that I could do better. I should've communicated more with other departments to ensure that there was no miscommunication. This happened because I didn't explain the requests more clearly and I thought they understood my requests but turned out not. This had slowed down the progress when developing the website as they were unable to provide the content I requested by time. But after communication, we cleared all the confusion and we were able to collaborate.

Besides, I have to be more patient when making a request. I should control my sentiment better even if they didn't send me the contents I need on time. The situation would be not that bad if I had controlled my temper.

2 more weeks till wrapping up this event, good job everyone! Let's keep the pace till the end!
