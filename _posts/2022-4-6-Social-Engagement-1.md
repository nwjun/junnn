## Start of the Journey âœ¨

For this sem, I have taken Social Engagement. It's an interesting course, all of the class have to work together to plan and execute an event. This year, we will be collaborated with Meta (Yes! Meta Facebok!) to plan a 4-module event. I am interested to develop the website and managing social media so I joined the publicity department. So far, I really like our department's environment, all of the members are very responsible and caring.

## Our Job Scopes ðŸ”¥

- Create and manage Instagram and Facebook account for the program
- Prepare articles and news for the program
- Prepare the photo book after the program

## First Task! ðŸ¤©

The first thing we did after assigning job was a discussion to come out with the features of the website. Then, we decided to involve every one in the designing so we open it to other classmates. I was quite surprise as we got 3 design from our talented classmates ðŸ’–([Chen Ching Yen](https://chenchingyen.github.io/digiteen.github.io/), [Sam Wei Hong](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qhy6MRno1U_ve_poMcTHG5E71POFM4l3/view?usp=sharing), [Janice & Jasmine](https://sites.google.com/d/1FN3G4La4OCIbIAPlNwDkmQThz8fkumgI/p/12W7cxFhx5vgrVZwpmdtx-S0uTliy7aNy/edit)). Love yall ðŸ¥° !!! Ching Yen even coded the website in just a week! Wow! Shiao Yin(from Publicity too) and I also [designed one](https://www.figma.com/file/ma1UavjVwepQZJh3Vw9Wyw/Social-Engagement?node-id=0%3A1). After receiving their desing, we intergrated some of their ideas into our design.
