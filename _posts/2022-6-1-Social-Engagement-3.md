## Relation with the Community

We are grateful to have such big support from youngsters to participate in our programs. Up to today, we had held 3 programs, namely "Digital Privacy", "Digital Opportunity" and "Digital Security".

Digital Privacy introduces participants to the malicious software so that they can protect themselves, especially during this time when exploitation of users' privacy is at an all-time high.

Digital Opportunity exposes participants to the algorithms in our daily life and gives them a chance to design their ones in groups.

The third module, Digital Security teaches participants to protect themselves from online fraud and different types of scams such as financial scams, donation scams, lottery scams and charity scams.

As the publicity team, we also posted posters and videos to attract participants from different faculties. I learned to put myself in others' shoes when writing the advertising content as I have to think about what users want to take away from this event and what kind of content attracts them. Even a small post takes time to be refined and refined to make sure it is nearly perfect for us. (It's impossible to be perfect! :> )

I wish I could join the program but unfortunately, I have another important event on the same day as our event. But from what I heard from the attendees, they learned a lot of knowledge from our event and they don't regret joining our event. Some of them don't have the opportunity to know more about the technical stuff but this event provides a platform to expose them to technologies. Besides, they also feedback that they have made some friends as they were split into small groups for discussion. Kudos to the Module Department for planning them and Meta for providing the materials.

I'm very happy to hear their feedback and this makes me feel a sense of satisfaction as I have contributed myself to making our society more knowledgable.

Through this community project, I really learn a lot of things that cannot be learned through reading or attending classes. Communication skills and time management are the most important lesson I have learned. I'll elaborate more about it in the next post, so stay tuned!
