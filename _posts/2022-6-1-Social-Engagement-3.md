## Relation with the Community

We are grateful to have such big support from youngsters to participate in our programs. Up to today, we had held 3 programs, namely "Digital Privacy", "Digital Opportunity" and "Digital Security".

I wish I could join the program but unfortunately, I have another important event on the same day as our event. But from what I heard from the attendees, they learned a lot of knowledge from our event and they don't regret joining our event. Some of them don't have the opportunity to know more about the technical stuff but this event provides a platform to expose them to technologies. Besides, they also told me that they have made some friends as they were split into small groups for discussion. Kudos to the Module Department for planning them and Meta for providing the materials.

Through this community project, I really learn a lot of things that cannot be learned through reading or attending classes. Communication skills and time management are the most important lesson I have learned. I'll elaborate more about it in the next post, stay tuned!
