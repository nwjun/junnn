## What is a Chord Diagram

A chord diagram shows flows between a set of entities. It displays entities all around a circle and connects entities with arcs.

Chord diagrams are attractive and they visualize weighted relationships between several entities. There are a few slightly modified outputs and the way to read them:
    • Flow. Two ways to represent it:
        ◦ One asymmetric arc per pair
        ◦ Two arcs per pair
    • Bipartite: Nodes are grouped in a few categories. Connections go between categories but not within categories.

There are some common mistakes we should avoid:
    • The order of the group around the circle is critical. Reduce the number of arc crossings as much as possible.
    • The figure is unreadable due to mental clutter. Weak connections should be avoided.
    • Chord diagrams are extremely difficult to comprehend. When presenting it, give audience plenty of explanation. It is recommended that the graphic be broken down and presented in stages.

## Example

Here’s the example of generating a chord diagram by using `circlize` packages in `R` :

Creating a `tibble` that shows the sentiment of each part of the `tidy_text`.

```R
# Mood Ring
grid.col = c("1" = "#51BBFE", "2" = "#8FF7A7", "3" = "#F4E76E", "anger" = "grey", "anticipation" = "grey", "disgust" = "grey", "fear" = "grey", "joy" = "grey", "sadness" = "grey", "surprise" = "grey", "trust" = "grey")

part_mood = tidy_text %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))%>%
  filter(!sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative")) %>%
  count(sentiment, part) %>%
  group_by(part, sentiment) %>%
  summarise(sentiment_sum = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

![part_mood](/assets/images/text-analysis-with-R/part_mood.png "part_mood")_Mood in Every Part_

Plotting the graph:

```R
circos.clear()
circos.par(gap.after = c(rep(5, length(unique(part_mood[[1]])) - 1 ), 15,
                         rep(5, length(unique(part_mood[[2]])) - 1 ), 15))
chordDiagram(part_mood, grid.col = grid.col, transparency = .2)
title("Relationship Between Mood and Part")
```
