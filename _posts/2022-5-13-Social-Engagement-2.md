## Execution of the Project

Finally, our proposal has been approved! We also chose the final website design by voting with everyone on the team. Then, we split the task among our publicity team so that each of us can contribute together.

## Task Distribution

Swee Nien, Wei Xin and I are responsible for developing the website and the rest will be handling the social media.

Our development of the website started by distributing the task. Each of us will do different pages. My task is to develop the website for "event", "gallery", "leaderboards" and "FAQ".

## Teamwork

Starting last Friday, I started to do my part. The hardest page is "event" and the others are quite easy. One of the modules of the "event" page is the most challenging one as it allows users to switch between event modules and it will show different content based on what users selected. A lot of things to consider when building the component. The responsive layout is very tedious as we have to adjust it to common phone layouts to ensure every user will have the best user experience when using the website and I have to make sure the QR code, timetable, mindmap and infographic are all at a good place.

I think the members of our team are very helpful. We always back each other up. When I faced difficulties in developing, I asked for help from Wei Xin and he was very helpful in helping to solve the problems. Since we needed the content and pictures from the other department, we first put some dummy data into the website. After they finalize their content, they will pass the data to us and we will put them on the website. When Swee Nien faced problems, I also helped him by sharing my experience with him and at last, we were able to solve them.

## Thoughts

I am quite satisfied with our development pace as we only started to do it for a week and the progress is already about 70%. I also appreciate this opportunity for me to practice website development with React.
